This is my first personal blog. The only experience I have related to building a website is a wordpress site used for my graduate application. But I've always been interested in the web technology, I watched quite a lot of tuts+ and lynda tutorial, learnt html5, css3 and javascript, along with several interesting things that could be used for web page, such as three.js and processing.
